# Task 3: Writing from scratch

### Requirements

Implement a small example (HTML+CSS+JS) of an expandable block that holds text.

Required features:

1. The block should have the same width as its container.
2. By default the block should be collapsed.
3. When collapsed, the block should display only 3 lines of text (**important:** _regardless of the width of the block container_).
4. When the block is collapsed, there should be a button **'read more'** below the text.
5. Clicking on the **'read more'** button, the user should be able to expand the block.
6. Expanded block shows the full text that it holds.
7. When the block is expanded, there should be a button **'show less'** below the text.
8. Clicking on the **'show less'** button, the user should be able to collapse the block.
9. If the text in the block is shorter than 3 lines or is exactly 3 lines, both the **'read more'** and the **'show less'** buttons shouldn't be displayed.
