# Westwing Frontend Coding Test

Hi there! We're happy that you decided to complete our coding test.

This test consists of 4 tasks.

1. [Task 1](task1.js) (Refactoring)
2. [Task 2](task2.js) (Refactoring to ES6)
3. [Task 3](task3.md) (Writing from scratch)
4. [Task 4](task4.md) (Writing from scratch with React)

We designed it to be well balanced between being descriptive and taking not much of your time.

The more of these tasks you do â€” the better. If you're not familiar with React, it's fine. You can implement the task with the any of the frameworks that you know. But we'd prefer it to be React as it's more relevant to what we use.

Please put your code to a public Github repo, JSFiddle or anywhere where we can access it easily to check, and then send us a link to it.

Good luck!
